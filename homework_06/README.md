# Homework: Module 6 - Unsupervised learning

The proposed tasks must be completed in the form of one jupyter notebook.

## Task 1

This dataset (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zvz20Iqeia1eEtFbGa3NcIrt_SNSimP6/view) needs to be loaded in this task. Here you will find 2 files - 2D dataset and mnist dataset. For each of them, apply the K-means algorithm for clustering. To find the optimal number of clusters, use the elbow method.

## Task 2

Visualize the result of clustering. For the case of the mnist dataset, you still need to use the PCA algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of your data to a 2-dimensional version.
