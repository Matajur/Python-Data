# Homework: Module 11 - Recurrent neural networks

As a homework assignment, it's needed to create a recurrent neural network using Keras engines that will classify reviews from the imdb dataset.

Unlike the example in module 9, we will use a recurrent neural network. Experiment with network structure - RNN, LSTM, two-way and deep.

Compare the results and draw conclusions.
