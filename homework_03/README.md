# Homework: Module 3 - Classical machine learning

This homework will be entirely related to linear regression and its implementation. Divide the homework into several parts:

* write the linear regression hypothesis function in vector form;
* create a function to calculate the loss function in vector form;
* implement one step of gradient descent;
* find the best $\vec{w}$ parameters for the dataset predicting house price depending on square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms;
* find the same parameters using an analytical solution;
* compare the results obtained.
