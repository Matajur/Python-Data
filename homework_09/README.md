# Homework: Module 9 - Selection of neural network hyperparameters

As a homework assignment, you are asked to create a neural network using Keras engines that will classify products from the fasion_mnist dataset (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist).

It is up to you to propose your own network architecture. The accuracy of the most naive but adequate neural network is approximately 91%. The accuracy of your model should not be lower than this indicator. To achieve such values you will need to experiment with network hyperparameters:

* number of layers;
* the number of neurons;
* activation functions;
* number of epochs;
* batch size;
* choice of optimizer;
* various regularization techniques, etc.

Use the techniques you've learned to identify neural network learning problems, and then experiment.
Make the solution in the form of a separate notebook.
