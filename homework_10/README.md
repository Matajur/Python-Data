# Homework: Module 10 - Convolutional neural networks

## Part 1

As a homework assignment, it's needed to create a neural network using Keras engines that will classify products from the fasion_mnist dataset.

Unlike the previous task, the task is to create a convolutional neural network. Choose a network architecture and train it on data from the fasion_mnist dataset. Try to achieve the highest possible classification accuracy by manipulating network parameters. Compare the accuracy of the resulting convolutional network with the accuracy of the multilayer network from the previous task. Draw conclusions.

## Part 2

Continuation of work with the fasion_mnist dataset.

Unlike the previous task, it's needed to create a convolutional neural network using VGG16 as a convolutional basis.

Train the resulting network on data from the fasion_mnist dataset. Try to achieve the highest possible classification accuracy by manipulating network parameters. During training, use pretraining techniques and feature selection.

Compare the accuracy of the resulting convolutional network with the accuracy of the multilayer network from the previous task. Draw conclusions.
