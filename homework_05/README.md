# Homework: Module 5 - Other learning algorithms with a teacher

In the homework for this module, you will practice doing a test task for employment. According to the accelerometer data from the mobile phone, it is necessary to classify what kind of activity a person is engaged in: walking, standing, running or climbing stairs. You can find the dataset by following the link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nzrtQpfaHL0OgJ_eXzA7VuEj7XotrSWO/view).

Use SVM and random forest algorithms from the scikit-learn library. As characteristics, you can take indicators from the accelerometer, but in order to improve the performance of the algorithms, you can first prepare our dataset and calculate time domain features. More of these characteristics are described in this article (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-18YEmp0YjV3hN9iI8J1i_FWd55HFwOK/view).

Compare the performance results of both algorithms on different features and different models.
